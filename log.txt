// on twitter to insta

// last update 9/14/2024
// 5:20 PM PST +/- 5min

// okay im saving these images

// to pull them up in photos
// instead of snipping tool

// less borders, more easily readible, this stream is only 1080p not 1440

// obs soon and i can stream in higher res (more complex tho)

// is anyone recording this stream? plz tweet @ me if you are!!! @kryptoklob

// last update 1726359640 unix-seconds (not millis)

// which BY THE WAY GUESS WHAT I JUST LEARNED ABOUT THAT

// nukes. 1970. that's when UNIX TIME STARTED OMGGGGGG

(i think i googled this yesterday)

// i love learning and stuff

// so now that i've saved these images in my vault

// and my vault = obsidian = also how i publish my website lol

// i can publish this TO MY WEBSITE REALLY FAST and tweet about it and people will be like 

// WTF HOW U DO THIS UR MAGIC

// Indeed. I *am* magic.
// HERE GOES LOLOLOLOLOL

// putting on music // you can listen along here:
// @spotify finding the "listen along with me" link on desktop // win11 is kinda hard - just some ux feedback for you <3 LOVE spotify tho been using it for like 15 years.

// 10xdev <-- me

// you guys check out 
kryptoklob.io/work-stuff yet?

// see since I HELD those meetings and there's literally no company ip there?

// i can put it on my website.

// <3 you Andreeseen ty for following me on twitter <3 

// "klob stop this is unprofessional"

// so is lying about me to vc, investors, and other people that need to know what kind of person I am if they're going to invest in my companies and such!

<3 (friends: dw about me being sued. i know people that will have my back if i am. just like i told joey a few days ago. i'll have HIS back too if he ever gets sued again.)

// tweeting, facebooking, instagramming, all this stuff at the same time feels almost like djing; especially now that I'm listening to music, i'm kinda typing along to the beat, hittin' that POST and that TWEET button along with the beat - i love music. i love djing. and science is cool too.

// back to staying on task now. // educational content //

// lol to whomever on facebook was recently like "you gotta stop tweaking man"

// HAS HE EVER EVEN PLAYED STARCRAFT OMG THIS IS JUST CALLED HIGH APM AHAHAHAHAH

// i want to support my friend Ruchika; she literally told me to share/promote her on instagram and stuff, RECENTLY, and she's one of my closest friends. but...she's not supporting me right now. and so I'm going to stop advocating that people follow her.

// I don't know what to do here. Sigh. Whatever tweeting this out so that people know WHY i'm removing that photo from my stream. for now.

// @spaceghost if this gets too annoying please @ met or inbox me okay? <3 ty 

// i'm pretty sure she's watching the stream lol (𝟾𝟶% 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚏𝚒𝚍𝚎𝚗𝚝 𝚒𝚗 𝚝𝚑𝚊𝚝 𝚊𝚜𝚜𝚎𝚛𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗)
