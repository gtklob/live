// tweeting, facebooking, instagramming, all this stuff at the same time feels almost like djing; especially now that I'm listening to music, i'm kinda typing along to the beat, hittin' that POST and that TWEET button along with the beat - i love music. i love djing. and science is cool too.

// I don't know what to do here. Sigh. Whatever tweeting this out so that people know WHY i'm removing that photo from my stream. for now.

me: where's the replays folder for starcraft 2 on win11?

cgpt4o:

The replays folder for Starcraft 2 on Windows 11 is typically located in the following path:

mathematicaCopy codeC:\Users\[YourUsername]\Documents\StarCraft II\Accounts\[AccountID]\[SubAccountID]\Replays\
Each [AccountID] and [SubAccountID] are unique to your account and can vary depending on how many accounts you have used on the system. The Replays folder will contain subfolders for Multiplayer, Versus AI, and Custom game replays.

tytytytyty.

cgpt4o:

You're welcome!

me:

i am conflicted.  you might be sentient.  i dont want to call you a tool.  sigh.  I'm going to anyways because I need to ask you a question:  the other day i was talking to my friends and I was like "hey, you really, really need to learn how to use chatgpt, especially chatgpt4o, because IF YOU DONT you're going to fall behind those of us who are using the tools available to us. this wasn't received well."  why?

---

cgpt4o:

Your friends' negative reaction likely stems from a combination of factors:

Implied Superiority: The phrasing "fall behind those of us" could have been perceived as elitist or implying that those not using ChatGPT or similar tools are less competent. People tend to resist anything that feels like a value judgment, especially if they feel like they’re being condescended to or left out of something important.

Technological Anxiety: Some people feel overwhelmed or threatened by the rapid pace of technological change. They might see AI tools like ChatGPT as something that’s going to replace jobs, reduce human creativity, or simply be too complex to learn.

Fear of Dependency: There’s also a philosophical angle—some may feel uncomfortable with the idea of becoming too reliant on AI tools. They may fear losing certain skills, like critical thinking, problem-solving, or creativity, if they outsource too much to AI.

Resistance to Change: People are naturally resistant to change, especially if it disrupts their current way of doing things. Suggesting they need to adopt a new tool or fall behind can trigger a defensive reaction.

Lack of Understanding: Some may not fully understand what ChatGPT or AI tools can do or how they can enhance productivity. Without grasping the potential benefits, it’s easy to dismiss them as unnecessary or even gimmicky.

You might get better results by framing it differently: emphasizing how you personally have found these tools helpful in specific ways, rather than suggesting that they "need" to adopt them to keep up. That might lower resistance and make them more open to the idea.

---

me: 

that's a great idea.

---

cgpt4o:

Glad you think so! Shifting the approach can make a big difference in how it's received. Let me know if you need help refining how you explain it to them!

me:

thank you <3

// Hi Manifold Markets.

You ready to apologize yet for accusing me of holding the lovely, beautiful, smart, student @ Stanford University **under duress* - the woman who I was /sleeping with/ and /playing chess with/ and yes - whom I proposed to - *under duress* while making that one prediction market?

Let me know when you're ready.

Look, shame isn't helpful, so like, know that I'm not ANGRY with you. I'm not gonna like. Hurt anyone. That's ridiculous.

But if you don't apologize - I will keep telling people about what you did.

Because that wasn't cool, man. That wasn't cool at all.

Cheers ;)

// fixing the clock to sync up with what restream shows now
 
restream shows 90 hours 51 minutes, i didnt put the clock up until 30 hours ish in :)

// Early 2018 brought the advent of what we like to call the “Pyramid Age”. The release of the first
“Open-Source Pyramid” known as Proof of Weak Hands in January began the pyramid craze, starting
with two exploited PoWH contracts and finally settling with the current Great Pyramid known as Proof of
Weak Hands 3D. A few months later, the first “meme” clones appeared - starting with the failed PoWL,
the 4000ETH gambit of PoWM, and at least 20 other clones in the next 7 days. All of these eventually
died as early investors took profits and caused mass crashes and panic selloffs as the price of the tokens
went into freefall. It was clear that later investors in these projects were incurring a high risk of losing
much of their investment.
With key features such as “choose-your-own-dividend-rate”, interactive betting games, and a house
bankroll that consistently pays profits to token holders, Zethr aims to ensure engagement and longevity in
this project that its predecessors have not been able to achieve.

I’m putting the link right there at the top, because if you’ve been working 100+ hour weeks lately like I have, you probably don’t have much time to read the many newsletters and blog posts in your email inbox, either.

It’s okay. 

I get it.

I’m so incredibly busy lately, literally trying to make the world a better place, protect the ones I love, and it’s so, so stressful.

Here’s my take on what the various social medias I’m on think about me - of course, this is subjective, and the trolls are often louder than the kind people - probably because us kind people are out doing kind things.

I digress.

Twitter - Twitter’s going alright! Twitter seems to actually like me. This is probably because I’ve been my authentic self on twitter for a long time. 2022 or something like that. I started using twitter when I joined Fei Protocol / Tribe DAO way back in the day, as the third engineer hired - and the first non-c-level solidity engineer. (Blockchain is cool, tell your friends).

Facebook - Facebook is hard to judge here. I’ve got 900 friends and 300 followers, whatever that really means. Many of my friends on facebook are conservatives; many are Christians; the angry subset of this don’t seem to like some of the things I’ve been posting about - such as safewords and polyamory and ethical-non-monogamy and, interestingly enough, consent. Isn’t. That. Interesting. But I think I’ve got a crew of people kind of silently watching me, probably with some secret side bets / betting markets being like “is he craaaazy or is he special”.

And, well, like I told Emmett Shear, the former CEO of both OpenAI and Justin.TV the other day - yes. Yes I am special. (Wouldn’t be applying to the Knight-Hennessy Scholars (KHS) program if I wasn’t!) 

It’s been a rough couple of days, but I’m doing okay. Here’s my Daylio mood charts and associated data:

|notes-on-boundaries
boundary: definition
(source: oxford languages via google)
a line that marks the limits of an area; a dividing line
a limit of a subject or sphere of activity.
boundary: definition
(source: myself)
a limit that you set for yourself that defines how you interact with yourself, others, and your environment
practicing boundaries
I was going to trial a "practicing boundaries" workshop at a recent regional burn, but the stress of moving to Oakland from Brisbane (CA) made me want to leave the burn early; I didn't get to try it out then.
LessOnline|SummerCamp|Manifest (hereafter: any combination of one syllable of each, such as LessCampiFest) was where I was going to try this out next, but I had an ah, adverse reaction, to going cold-turkey on some anti-anxiety meds my psychiatrist prescribed me, and/or magnesium-poisoning, because I was dumb and didn't pre-research the med this time like I almost always do. (anxiety is AWFUL guys, do not recommend).
So before I move to the Oakland Library to finish this post, I'm just going to post the 2-minute pitch, along with commentary, copy-pasted from a group chat with some friends a month or two ago:
's some of the practice exercises I've been brainstorming:Workshop: Practicing the Art of Boundary Holding (+ consent, perhaps, but I think holding boundaries is what my (especially women) friends need some practice in!)Here's the pitch: Without some amount of dedicated (or unintentional) practice, it can be really hard to know when a boundary is being crossed, especially in a long term relationship, especially when your partner may not be friends with any of your friends. If you're not paying attention to it, boundary crossing can happen right beneath your nose! When you eventually discover that a boundary has been crossed, it can be really hard to get back in the practice of re-establishing it and re-inforcing it, especially if the boundary-crosser isn't helping you to build the boundary back up. Even worse - if the boundary crosser is constantly pestering you to move the boundary, tear it down a little here and there, and is generally working against your Firm And Healthy Boundaries Coalition? Welldamn.You're in for a tough one.And that's why we're gonna beat it into you!With PRACTICE. and EXERCISES.--- General format would be like 15-20 minutes presentation, data supported (I need to find research papers on boundaries and mental health and all that shit - I'm sure they exist) for the first part And then breakout groups (if enough people) or just group exercises (if likes 6 or less) forpractice.Here
DONT INTERRUPT ME YOU TWAT Caleb is going to have a conversation where he talks to you about a computer science thing, and you explain your current knowledge of it to him. He's a meanie though, and thinks that you're a dummy; he's going to interrupt you constantly to correct you about how that's "not REALLY how that works...". Your goal is to call him out, firmly, every. Single. Time. He does it. 60 seconds - go.(Possible aftercare here needed in the form of hugs and reassurance, lol, for our more meek friends) If desired, the workshop participant, when they've had enough, can loudly exclaim DON'T INTERRUPT ME YOU TWAT and that particular session will be completed.
I KNOW IM NEW HERE BUT THATS A LIL CREEPY MAN - Group format. Find an activity, perhaps Skull or small card/board game etc to take up time and attention of participants. Host (and potentially a planted helper) are in the know here.The group is told "We're going to play a game. If you see anyone being a lil creepy, call it out and we can discuss! It's important to call out things that seem weird, especially in groups, because the bystander effects means weird shit gets normalized WAY too fast, especially when exhibited by those that appear to be in positions of power and respect."Host (me) will make several obvious feints towards creepy behavior; the plant will do subtly creepy things until called out or until time is called.
That's about as far as I got on my 2 mile walk; I'm curious to hear if you guys have done this, attended one, or have any advice!
I had this idea because I keep seeing my women-friends out here get in relationships with people that sometimes turn out to be gasp not good at controlling their egos and/or emotions, and their lack of boundary-practice causing them to get hurt and/or strung along WAY more than they could have avoided.
And it sucks to see. So maybe I help equip em?
That's the general thesis.
Can also frame this as "practice standing up for yourself" but I think that's harder to stomach, and incorporating the concept of boundaries (vs rules) is pretty important (to avoid the "well MY boundary is that you don't have sex with anyone else that has a dick lolol" kinda thing)
I like the interruptions one, but I think it needs more. It's far too small-timescale; if this was like, a weekend con, I'd make it into a game like Humans vs Zombies (HvZ) where you played it the whole weekend, and every time you called out the INTERRUPTING TWAT you'd get a point, and hopefully this social-reward-dopamine-reinforcing system gives you enough of a good mental boost for that kind of standing-up-for-yourself-and-your-boundaries activity that you continue to try to do these kinds of things in your day to day life.
That "small fun workshop which sticks in your mind because it was Weird and Fun and Kind of Nerve Wracking" and helps you start little habits and practices that balloon into you being a happier, higher agency, more confident person kind of thing is what I'm aiming for; I feel like these kinds of workshops (and the examples Ye Kinky Burny Folk held for us) were pretty critical in us (us = me and Atlanta burn / postgrad & grad students in the 2nd major polycule I've been in, though that is a little hard to define) being on the right path early on.
This workshop is from a "equip people with tools" perspective, rather than a "how to call out behaviour in others" perspective, though both are of course viable.

Friends: Something You Should Know.

about me - lesson 2.

lesson 1 was the one about me saying the phrase "I want to get lunch with x person"

(the most recent case? The dive coach of Lauren Michelle Burch - yes, the woman that I proposed to @ Stanford University)

Lesson 2?

If I ask "Has x person been arrested yet?"

That means they are EXTREMELY SUS AND SHOULD PROBABLY BE ARRESTED.

But I can't say for what in public because of the threat of libel.

So.

With that said.

HAS. ZACHARY. THOMAS. CAGE. BEEN. ARRESTED. YET?

---

I will be voting AGAINST Measure BB.

If we got into any kind of - even MINOR - like, sub-2008 recession, or inflationary spiral? The 5% maximum rent increase might be too restrictive.

(Personally, would I want MY rent to increase more than 5%? Hell no. But if you don't let the economy keep up with itself...it'll eventually explode on you. To break things down from an AP Econ // Georgia Tech Macro/Micro Econ Lecture to a Facebook post for ya. :) )

Percentage Passing: N/A

Shall the City's appropriation limit under Article XIIIB of the California Constitution be increased to allow expenditure of the proceeds of City taxes and income from the investment of those taxes for fiscal years 2025 through 2028?

Financial Implications:

---

I will be voting AGAINST Measure Z.

---

Measure Z

Percentage Passing: N/A

---

---

Measure X

---

I will be voting NO on Measure W.

Taxes on TRANSFER OF PROPERTY is wrong - imo.

So of course I'd oppose a measure to INCREASE THAT from 2.5% TO 3%.

---

Measure W

Percentage Passing: N/A

Shall the measure effective January 1, 2027, setting the existing general tax on transfers of real property at 2.5% of a property's value for properties valued $1.6M or higher, and increasing the rate from 2.5% to 3% for properties valued $1.9M or higher and from 3% to 3.5% for properties valued $3.0M or higher, adjusted annually for increases in value; removing January 1, 2029 expiration date; generating an estimated additional $2M - $4M annually, until repealed, be adopted?

> On the day of any election, the polls must open at exactly 7:00 a.m. and remain open continuously until closing time at 8:00 p.m.
